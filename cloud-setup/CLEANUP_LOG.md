# Cloud Setup Cleanup Log

## Files Removed (Legacy/Obsolete)

The following files were removed after switching to the official Cedalo installer:

### Legacy Installation Scripts
- `install.sh` - Custom installer with known installation loop issues
- `deploy.sh` - Old deployment script 
- `clean-reinstall.sh` - Custom reinstall script
- `fix-streamsheets.sh` - Legacy fix script for custom setup
- `fix-mosquitto.sh` - Mosquitto-specific fix script

### Legacy Configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Custom compose file that caused authentication conflicts
- `mosquitto/` folder - Separate Mosquitto configuration (not needed with official installer)

### Legacy Documentation
- `502_ERROR_FIX.md` - Specific to custom setup issues
- `CLEAN_REINSTALL_GUIDE.md` - Guide for custom installation cleanup
- `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` - Covered multiple installation methods (confusing)

## Why These Were Removed

1. **Official installer handles everything** - No need for custom scripts
2. **Eliminates confusion** - Clear single installation path
3. **Prevents issues** - Legacy scripts had known problems
4. **Cleaner repository** - Focus on what actually works

## What Remains

- `cedalo-install.sh` - Official installer script
- `README.md` - Updated installation guide
- `OFFICIAL_INSTALLER_GUIDE.md` - Complete official installation guide
- `INSTALLATION_LOOP_FIX.md` - Historical analysis (kept for reference)
- `CLEANUP_LOG.md` - This cleanup documentation

## Cleanup Status

✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

All legacy files have been removed. The cloud-setup folder now contains only the files needed for the official Cedalo installer approach.

## Final Structure

```
cloud-setup/
├── cedalo-install.sh              # Official installer script
├── README.md                      # Updated installation guide
├── OFFICIAL_INSTALLER_GUIDE.md    # Complete official guide
├── INSTALLATION_LOOP_FIX.md       # Historical analysis
└── CLEANUP_LOG.md                 # This cleanup documentation
```

This clean structure eliminates confusion and ensures users follow the official, reliable installation method.
